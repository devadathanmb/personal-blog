Well, who am I? I'm Devadathan M B, a 2024 Computer Science Engineering graduate, currently working as a Member of Technical Staff (MTS) at [Fyle](https://www.fylehq.com/).

My days are spent learning and crafting backend systems, and I bet I pick up something new every day. I’m definitely more of a backend guy, but hey, I think [React compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) is cool, and [Qwick signals](https://qwik.dev/docs/components/state/) are pretty neat too. So don’t underestimate my frontend knowledge, even if I still might struggle with centering a div at times.

Outside of tech, I’m a big supporter of open-source software, driven by the freedom and collaboration ideals of the [Linux](https://linux.org/) and [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) community.

Yeah, that’s still tech-related, but if you’re interested in different takes on life and tech and how they intersect, feel free to stick around. It’s all about making sense of this chaotic world we live in.

## Tools I use

Just to remind myself, what even am I using.

- **Editor**: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  - Or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) when I need to get some actual work done lol
- **Personal Desktop**: [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
- **Terminal**: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- **Others**: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

_Want to see my beautifully ~curated~ riced desktop, which I have ~wasted time~ lovingly crafted over all these years? Check out my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/devadathanmb/dotfiles)._
