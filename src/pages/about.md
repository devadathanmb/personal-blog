Who am I? If you've been paying attention, you might have a hint. I'm Devadathan M B, a 2024 Computer Science Engineering graduate, currently diving into the world of software engineering as an intern at Fyle.

My days are filled with the challenge of crafting efficient backend systems that never quite meet my own high standards.

But donâ€™t take that too seriouslyâ€”Iâ€™m focused on backend work for now, though Iâ€™m open to tackling any challenging problem that comes my way.

Outside of tech, Iâ€™m a passionate advocate for open-source software, driven by the values of freedom and collaboration championed by the Linux and FOSS community.

Well, thatâ€™s still some tech, I guess? ðŸ˜„ Anyway, if youâ€™re interested in exploring a variety of perspectives on life and technology, and how they intersect, feel free to stick around. Itâ€™s all about trying to make sense of this chaotic world we live in.
