Who even am I? Well, you might already have an inkling (if you've been paying attention). I'm Devadathan M B, a freshly-minted 2024 graduate in Computer Science Engineering. Currently, I'm honing my craft as a software engineering intern at Fyle.

My days are spent meticulously trying to craft high-performant backend systems that never seem to fully satisfy expectations.

Please don't take that too seriously thoughâ€”I'm primarily focused on backend work for now. However, I'm always up for tackling any challenging problem that comes my way.

Beyond the lines of code, I'm a staunch supporter of open-source software, inspired by the principles of freedom and collaboration that define the Linux and FOSS community.

So, if you're curious about how a software engineer like me navigates through the bits and bytes of technology while trying to make sense of the chaotic world we live in, stick around.
