## Setting the Stage: A Brief Overview

As of early July, while writing this blog, I am currently working as an Engineering Intern at [Fyle](https://www.fylehq.com), having joined the company just over a month ago. 

Fyle is a SaaS expense management software that simplifies expense tracking and management. Founded in 2018, Fyle transitioned to full remote operations in 2020. 

This blog captures my firsthand experience at the Fyle offsite, a biannual event that promises both fun and camaraderie among colleagues.

## Why am I even wrtiting this?

Writing this blog is a departure from my usual habits of not sharing much online. I don't often post on social media or share personal updates.

However, my experience at Fyle's recent offsite was profoundly memorable and heartwarming for me. The main purpose behind documenting these memories in words is to ensure that I never forget the moments that made this experience special.

Even if my memory fades, I can revisit these pages and relive the joy and camaraderie we shared. This blog may turn out longer than expected, as I aim to capture every detail and emotion.

Ultimately, I hope it serves as a source of comfort during challenging times, reminding me of the good memories when needed the most.


## The journey begins
### From Curiosity to Participation: The Offsite Journey

I joined Fyle on May 16th, amidst the final rush of my end semester exams. Earlier in May, I had my interviews and accepted the offer on May 9th. During my initial research about Fyle, I stumbled upon a [blog](link_placeholder) by Roshan Mahtre, an MTS at Fyle, where he detailed his experiences with Fyle's offsite events. At the time, though, the idea of an offsite didn't particularly excite me, despite Khushi from the People Success team briefly mentioning it during onboarding.

One afternoon, I had the chance to meet my manager, Kartikey Rajvaidya, over a call to discuss our roles and projects at Fyle. Later that evening, Kartikey messaged me urgently on Slack about an opportunity regarding the offsite. Even though the registration deadline had already passed, Kartikey asked if my friend Prabhakar Mishra and I, who had also just joined as interns, could still attend.

I hesitated. This was my first professional experience, and I was unsure about how things worked at Fyle, how people interacted, or what an offsite entailed. Would I fit in? Would I understand everything that was happening? These uncertainties swirled in my mind. Despite these doubts, I took a leap of faith and agreed, curious to see what awaited me.

The very next day, I received a message from [Yitzhak](linkedin_profile_link_here) from the People Success team to fill out the [RSVP form](#). It covered flight ticket preferences and food preferences. And yeah, Fyle covers all travel and accommodation expenses; you don't have to pay a single penny.

### The Work Journey: Before the offsite 
After joining Fyle, my initial weeks were spent meeting people and completing the curated onboarding coursework provided by Fyle for a comprehensive onboarding experience. Balancing work alongside my ongoing exams posed a challenge, but I managed to navigate both successfully.

During these early weeks, I immersed myself in various coursework related to our team's activities. One notable milestone was delivering my first product demo to the entire company, a Fyle tradition aimed at familiarizing newcomers with our product. While these experiences were significant, my primary focus was on gaining a deeper understanding of our product's functionality and technology.

Thanks to the guidance and support from senior colleague Kiriti Gautam and others, I tackled my first tasks and subsequent assignments promptly and effectively. The offsite, initially, was not at the forefront of my mind; rather, I was driven to excel in my role and contribute meaningfully to our team's objectives.

Amidst the routine, there were intriguing developments in the `#offsite_july_2024` Slack channel, including announcements like the upcoming cricket tournament. However, one particular challenge caught my attention—a requirement to schedule a call with someone new and share their best childhood memory and secret talent on the channel.

Initially perplexed by the challenge amidst ongoing exams, I eventually scheduled a call with Suyash Patil, another MTS at Fyle whom I had never met before. Bonding over a shared interest in chess, we had a thorough discussion spanning various topics, including the challenge itself. Soon after our call, I posted our conversation on the channel, sparking immediate interest and speculation about the mystery caller.

### Countdown to the Offsite: Anticipation Builds

Soon enough, I realized how quickly time flies. The offsite was scheduled for the first week of July (specifically July 5th). While I was starting to settle into my role after the initial overwhelm of being a newcomer, I still harbored doubts about how the offsite would unfold. It would be my first time meeting many of my colleagues in person, despite our weekly sync-up calls as a team. This mix of skepticism and curiosity left me both excited and nervous about the upcoming gathering.

As the date approached, during the last week before the offsite, I received my tickets and the detailed itinerary. It was finally time to pack for the offsite. Despite lingering doubts, I gathered my belongings, preparing for what lay ahead.

### Offsite Days

#### Day 0
Day 0 of the offsite was dedicated to travel. Participants from various locations, including myself, traveled to Bangalore to prepare for the upcoming events. We were grouped based on our flight arrival times at Bangalore Airport to facilitate coordination and travel to our accommodation at the Holiday Inn in Indira Nagar, Bangalore—a detail I'll delve into shortly.

My flight was scheduled to depart at 12:45 PM, arriving in Bangalore around 2:15 PM. After packing and going through the usual airport procedures, I boarded the flight. Despite a less-than-ideal flight experience, thankfully, the journey from Kochi to Bangalore was relatively short. Upon arrival at the Bangalore Airport, I wandered through the departure terminal, feeling a bit like a lost child, searching for my group. Unable to locate them, I reached out to Supratik, who was nearby. We connected, and soon after, we found Simran as well. With the group together, we were ready to head to the hotel.

That initial interaction at the airport marked my first in-person encounter with colleagues from Fyle, and I quickly realized how fantastic they were. Conversations flowed effortlessly as we shared about ourselves and our roles at Fyle. Gradually, I began to feel more at ease and settled into the group dynamic.

While we were ready to depart, we decided to wait for Puru Kaushik from the CS team, who had encountered a funny mishap—his bag had been misplaced. We shared laughs about the situation, lightening the mood as we waited for him to join us. Once Puru arrived, we hailed a cab and made our way to the Holiday Inn in Indira Nagar.

During the journey, our discussions ranged from work-related matters to personal anecdotes and jokes. By the time we reached the hotel, I already felt at home among my new colleagues.

After a journey of over an hour from the airport, I finally arrived at the hotel around 4:30 PM. Checking in, I immediately connected with fellow attendees. Soon after, I headed to the room I shared with Prabhakar, a fellow newcomer to Fyle. After receiving a message from Prabhakar about our team gathering on the top floor, I eagerly joined them—meeting my beloved team members in person for the first time was a truly special moment. 

There were so many amazing people present that it's hard to name them all without missing someone. Nevertheless, everyone I met was incredibly warm and welcoming. We returned to our room for a relaxed chat, even calling up Prasad, a former Fyle employee in Bangalore, to catch up and share laughs.

During our conversations, I had the pleasure of meeting Astha Bisht from the frontend team, who amusingly kept noting my resemblance to a former Fyle employee. 

Eventually, we decided to venture out for dinner and booked cabs to Meghana Foods, a renowned biryani spot in Bangalore. We ordered a mix of veg and non-veg biryanis, along with other delectable dishes, enjoying not just the food but also the endless banter and jokes shared by our senior colleagues. 

The cab rides were just as entertaining, filled with both light-hearted jokes and meaningful conversations. 

Back at the hotel, we continued the fun by playing cards until midnight—an unexpectedly delightful experience despite my eventual loss. The evening was punctuated by the arrival of several interesting personalities, adding to the lively atmosphere. 

Reflecting on the day, it struck me how seamlessly I had integrated into the group; it felt as if I had known everyone for years. It was undeniably one of the most enjoyable moments I had experienced in recent years. 

As everyone retired to their rooms for the night, we lingered a while longer, sharing stories about our lives before finally calling it a night. And with that, Day 0 concluded—function returned 0 without any errors, just like in programming terms, but with a lot more joy and camaraderie.
