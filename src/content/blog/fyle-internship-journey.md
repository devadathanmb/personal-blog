Got it! Here's the revised version with that change:

**This is Part 2 of my blog about my internship at Fyle.** In this part, I’ll dive into the technical side of my experience. If you haven’t read Part 1 yet, you can find it [here](/blog/fyle-internship).

### First Week

#### Before Onboarding

I officially joined Fyle on May 16, 2024, right when my final semester exams were about to start. I was in the middle of exam break, but honestly, exams were the last thing on my mind. I’m still surprised at how I managed to learn the entire syllabus in just one week before the exams, every single time.

Anyway, back to the internship. I had already received my laptop and set everything up a few days before my start date. The day before joining, I got access to my Fyle workspace email and started receiving emails to set up accounts for various tools we use, including Slack. I quickly set everything up and was ready to start.

I also got invites to a few meetings, including deployment calls, which confused me a bit at first. I had no clue about our release schedules back then.

#### Onboarding

On my first day, I had an onboarding call scheduled in the morning. Khushi led the onboarding process, and another intern, Prabhakar, also joined on the same day. We later ended up working closely throughout the internship. During the session, Khushi gave us a quick introduction to Fyle, how things work, the tools we use, and the company culture. She also covered the benefits and perks we’d get as interns. We were then assigned tasks related to security compliance and a few other things.

Later that day, we met our manager, Kartikey, who had hired both of us. We had a brief chat about how engineering operates at Fyle, what projects we’d be working on, and what was expected from us. He shared an onboarding document outlining tasks to complete in the first three weeks.

That same day, I also got an invite to the Fyle offsite, which I’ve written about [here](/blog/fyle-offsite).

#### Initial days

The first week was mostly spent on meeting new people, reading about the engineering architecture at fyle and completeing the onboarding tasks assigned to me. I was also assigned a buddy, Sanskar, who is a principal engineer at Fyle. He helped me with any questions I had and guided me through the codebase.
